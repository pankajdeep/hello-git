1. We have created a repository on github and we want to clone it in our system, so we use the clone command:-
git clone <URL of repository copied from github>

2. After doing some changes in a file, we want to put the file in a repository on github we use the following commands:-
I) To add the file in the staged area use command-
git add -A
II) To save our file from staged area onto git's local database use command-
git commit -m "<Message>"
III) Now, to push the file onto GITHUB server use command-
git push -u origin master
IV) To check the status of our file use command-
git status

3. The commands that are used to tell git our username and password of github are-
I)git config --global user.name "<Username>"
II)git config --global user.email "<email>"

The 3rd commands are to be run only one time.
